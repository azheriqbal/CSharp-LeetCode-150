# Description:

Welcome to the "C# LeetCode Practice with NUnit" repository! üöÄ This repository contains a collection of 150 coding practice solutions for LeetCode problems using the C# programming language. Each solution is accompanied by its corresponding test cases written using the NUnit testing framework.

# Why Contribute or Use this Repository?

* Enhance your C# coding skills by tackling a diverse range of LeetCode problems.
* Learn how to write efficient algorithms and solutions to common programming challenges.
* Understand the importance of writing comprehensive test cases using NUnit.
* Explore different problem-solving techniques and strategies.
* Get familiar with best practices in code organization, readability, and maintainability.

# How to Use:
* Browse the list of LeetCode problems, each organized in its own directory.
* Inside each problem directory, you'll find the C# solution file and its corresponding NUnit test file.
* Study the solution to understand the algorithm and approach.
* Run the NUnit test cases to validate the correctness of the solution.
* Experiment with your own variations or optimizations.
